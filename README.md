# Direct Construction of Minimal Acyclic Subsequential Transducers
Construct a dictionary (str -> str map) of words.
The algorithm constructs subsequential transducers, 
which is part of the more advanced theory of finate state machines.

The algorithm is from **Stoyan Mihov** and Denis Maurel paper
